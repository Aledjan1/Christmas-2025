				<p>The Christmas tree is an evergreen tree, usually a pine, spruce, or fir, that is decorated with lights, ornaments, and tinsel during the Christmas season. Christmas trees can be fresh-cut, grown in pots, or artificial, and they are commonly placed indoors in homes, churches, and public buildings. In some places, large outdoor Christmas trees are displayed in town centres and decorated with festive lights.</p>
				<p>Although the Christmas tree is often connected with Christian symbolism, such as eternal life and hope, its modern use is mostly secular. Today, the Christmas tree is a symbol of celebration, joy, and family traditions rather than a religious object for many people.</p>
				<p>The tradition of the modern Christmas tree began in western Germany. In the Middle Ages, religious plays about Adam and Eve featured a “paradise tree,” which was usually a fir tree decorated with apples. This tree represented the Garden of Eden and later influenced the tradition of decorating Christmas trees. Over time, apples were replaced by ornaments, and candles were added to represent light.</p>
				<p>Today, decorating the Christmas tree is a popular family activity and an important part of Christmas celebrations around the world.</p>
