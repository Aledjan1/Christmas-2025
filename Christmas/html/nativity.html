				<h2>Nativity</h2>
					<p>The Nativity refers to the birth of Jesus Christ and is one of the most important events in Christianity. According to the Bible, Jesus was born in Bethlehem to Mary and Joseph. His birth is described in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke and is celebrated by Christians all over the world at Christmas.</p>
					<p>Nativity scenes are artistic displays that show the moment of Jesus’ birth. They usually include figures such as Mary, Joseph, the baby Jesus, angels, shepherds, and the Three Wise Men. These scenes can be found in churches, homes, and public places during the Christmas season. In some countries, life-size Nativity scenes are displayed in town squares.</p>
					<p>A Nativity play, also known as a Christmas pageant, is a performance that retells the story of Jesus’ birth. It is often performed by children in schools or churches. The play includes scenes such as the angel Gabriel’s message to Mary, the journey to Bethlehem, and the visit of the shepherds and Wise Men.</p>
					<p>Today, the Nativity is both a religious symbol and a cultural tradition. For Christians, it represents hope, humility, and peace. For many people, Nativity scenes and plays are an important part of Christmas celebrations and help to remind them of the meaning of the holiday.</p>
